### Adding to Other Messaging Apps
#### Custom Telegram client apps (Supported)
There are numerous Telegram client apps available in multiple platforms. These apps are automatically supported as long as they support Telegram's specification.

#### WhatsApp (Partial)
Currently, WhatsApp expects sticker creators to publish sticker packs as separate installable mobile apps. See https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/26000226 for details. Developing those apps may take a long time to publish, noticing several complaints from creators for their packs were rejected in respective app store for numerous reasons. (Such as [WhatsApp/stickers#230](https://github.com/WhatsApp/stickers/issues/230))

There are a few apps that allows conversion of Telegram stickers to Whatsapp, most notably [Unofficial telegram stickers for WhatsApp](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dstukalov.watelegramstickers) in Android. One known issue for using our sticker set in WhatsApp is that stickers will have a tall vertical margin due to differences in sticker specification between WhatsApp and Telegram.

#### LINE (Send as Image only)
Currently, LINE expects creators to publish stickers to [LINE Creators Market](https://creator.line.me/) which requires legal registration as well as approval for publishing the stickers.

There are no intention of selling this as a paid sticker set, yet selling stickers for free is currently [not possible](https://help2.line.me/creators/web/categoryId/20002305/3/pc) in LINE Creators Market. The minimum possible price for a product is 50 LINE Coins(about US$0.99).

Alternatively, you may download our sticker set from https://github.com/reinhart1010/sat and send one of them as image.

#### Discord (Send as Image only)
Discord currently does not support stickers, but you may download our sticker set from https://github.com/reinhart1010/sat and send one of them as image. If you are an administrator for one of Discord servers, adding this sticker set to one of "sticker bots" is also possible (and legal).

#### Tembok Syahdan (Supported)
Due to the nature of Tembok Syahdan, it is very possible to add our sticker set to the app. We are looking forward to include our stickers to be one of the default sets in Tembok Syahdan.

#### Other Apps
Our sticker set is available for download for free in https://github.com/reinhart1010/sat.
